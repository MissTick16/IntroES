This assignment contains a couple of functions that can analyze an array of unsigned char data 
items and report analytics on the maximum, minimum, mean, and median of the data set. The data 
set is reordered this data set from large to small. All statistics are rounded down to the 
nearest integer. After analysis and sorting is done, data is pretty printed to the screen.

 
**Details:**
`print_statistics()` - A function that prints the statistics of an array including minimum, maximum, mean, and median
`print_array()` - Given an array of data and a length, prints the array to the screen
`find_median()` - Given an array of data and a length, returns the median value
`find_mean()` - Given an array of data and a length, returns the mean
`find_maximum()` - Given an array of data and a length, returns the maximum
`find_minimum()` - Given an array of data and a length, returns the minimum
`sort_array()` - Given an array of data and a length, sorts the array from largest to smallest
